## Key Subsystem Notes

### 1. Storage & Boot Stability
- **UFS ICE Bypass**: The inline crypto engine phandle stall on the UFS controller is removed (`/delete-property/ qcom,ice;`) to prevent boot hangs and emergency shell timeouts.

---

## Linux 6.18 Port Fixes

### 1. UFS — boot hung during link training
**Problem**: The controller was negotiating gear/timing combinations the Samsung UFS part on this board can't lock, and it was also poking a reset line the board doesn't wire up, plus an inline-crypto phandle that stalled outright. Result: hang during mount, sometimes down to an emergency shell.

**Fix** (device tree only, no driver code):
- `freq-table-hz` — 8-row table, live gears `<37500000 300000000>`, dead gears `<0 0>` so the driver can't select them
- Deleted inherited `resets` / `reset-names`
- Deleted `qcom,ice`, disabled `&ice`

### 2. Memory map — auto-rotation and light sensor crashed the DSP
**Problem**: FastRPC buffers were mapped at an address the SDSP can't reach, so the SMMU raised Translation Fault `0x402` and `sensor_process` died.

**Fix** (`drivers/misc/fastrpc.c`):
- Map an alias address (`dma_addr + (sid << 32)`, SID `0x5a1`) into the same SMMU domain, point `buf->phys` at it
- Wait for `msm/slpi/root_pd` before mapping, so the protection domain exists first

### 3. Display — grey half and vertical seam
**Problem**: The DSI lane routing register was being skipped whenever the PLL enable refcount said it was already on. Upstream 6.18 also added a display-intf reset loop that blanked interfaces the bootloader had already handed over.

**Fix**:
- `dsi_phy_7nm.c` — always program `PLL_SYSTEM_MUXES` — confirmed fixed on hardware
- Dropped the intf reset loop; removed the panel's 90° rotation; dropped `CLK_OPS_PARENT_ENABLE` on the pixel clocks; restored `pm_runtime` around PLL init
